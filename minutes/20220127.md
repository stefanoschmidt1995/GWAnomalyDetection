### General discussion

There is general consensus on working on Fractal dimension as the only (so far) feature to describe the data.

Probably auxiliary channels we considered are not good (due to a sampling rate issue): we should understand which one to use, to avoid to include in the analysis channels similar to each other. ASK SOMEONE EXPERT!

Walking through TOF paper: lots of fine tuning required. Maybe a more sophisticated ML model can help to avoid this...

The problem with clustering is that it doesn't take into account the temporal ordering between observation. This would be a nice thing to incorporate in the model.

Where do we want to focus first?
  - _Including auxiliary channels_. This involves to understand which channels we want to use
  - _Developing an anomaly detection scheme_. This involves to get a nice algorithm to detect anomalies in the FD time series.

We dediced to focus first on "Developing an anomaly detection scheme". However, when setting up an algorithm, we should keep in mind that it has to be easy to extend to a larger number of time series.

### Action items
  - Robin: create a FD time series for the strain channel
  - Melissa: check for trigger inside the given time series
  - Stefano: try MESA anomaly detection scheme on the FD time series
  - All: think about a nice anomaly detection scheme (LSTM? Clustering?)
