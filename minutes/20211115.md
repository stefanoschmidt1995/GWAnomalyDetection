### Data acquisition and pre-processing
The following data acquisition was decided:
- Following Section IV from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08693.pdf
- See DataQuality.ipynb in notebooks folder (runs in CIT)

The following data pre-processing was decided:
1. Downsampling from 16kHZ --> 4kHz
2. Whiten at the beginning of O3a and maintain this whitening 
3. Frequency cut (range for CBC) [30,500]


### Some notes regarding Roy's ideas:
- Calculating a "combination" of different detectors might not seem feasible due to the time shift --> GW come from all sky positions, so no "simple" mathematical formulation might be able to explain this. However, a NN might be able to "recognize" this time shift and "understand" that even if signals are shifted, they are still GW.
- The detector strain might not contain all necessary information to distinguish glitches from GW: a "combination" of auxiliary channels + strain might be useful for the algorithm

### Some homework:
- Read TimeGAN paper: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf
Note that there is a repository related to this paper: https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN
