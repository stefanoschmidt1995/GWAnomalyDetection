### Presentation

Robin showed [results](link/to/slides) from a classifier with CNN.

**Input**: pictures of time bin vs fractal dimension for the most important auxiliary channels labelled by the glitch type

**Output**: guess of the best glitch type

**Results**: 70% accuracy in classifying the right glitches. The network confuses Clean data and Tomte glitches.
Nice plots of the activation of the first convolutional layer for different class.

### Discussion

- Adding multiple channels to the pictures can help. The new features can be also something easy (raw strain?)
- How about providing pictures with multiple times length? This should be able to tackle the case where the glitch/anomaly is longer than expected
- To move further: add another class of glitch?
