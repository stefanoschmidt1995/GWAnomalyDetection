### General discussion
Robin presented his work: he built some code that allows for creating some time bins with the fractal dimension for several auxiliary channels.
Such computation is feasible: with a GPU, we are able to process O(1000) channels in real time.
They are stored in a hd5 file and are ready for being loaded and further manipulated.

The general consensus is to start to make some clustering with the data: PCA reduction + Dirichlet GMM. This could teach us somethihng on how to go on.

### Action items
- Robin: document his code and share it
- Stefano: take Robin's work and start to see how PCA + clustering look like
