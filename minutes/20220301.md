### General discussion

Robin presented his work with LSTM. It predicts one point at a time and it seems to capture only the mean of the FD timeseries.
Maybe this is an issue with the training? Melissa suggested to use Wasserstein distance instead of mean squared error.

Stefano made two remarks:
1. Autoregressive order of the FD timeseries is very low (around 200).
2. Are we sure there is something to learn? Maybe it's fine to see flat predictions as the autocorrelation between points falls pretty quickly.

There seems to be general consensus that maybe it's worth to try to predict more than one point at a time: maybe we see some improvements.

Melissa and Tom suggested to try TimeGAN model to forecast the FD timeseries. Robin made some explorations on that with some promising results

### Homework:
- Read TimeGAN paper: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf
Note that there is a repository related to this paper: https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN
Tom will present some notes with doubts/highlight from the paper
